2. $ mvn clean package
3. $ java -jar application-{version}.jar
4. Or can use below command:<br/>

### Architecture:<br/>
The architecture of this project is according to **Clean Architecture** to using benefits of Onion design.<br/>
This design help isolating and hiding entities and their relationships implementation from outside clients.<br/>
Two notes to consider is that:<br/>
1. Dependency of **business** and **persistence** modules are inversed. To preventing entities from being used in business module.
2. Dependency of persistence objects are injected by Spring container to business module.
